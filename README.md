# hello-world


Hello, Peeps!

Here's a short story to why I'm driven with coding life.
Well, I originally am interested in arts, but since my friend gave me her advice about my college plans, I considered what she told me as a helpful and good one. It cleared up my mind and it really helped me a lot easier to decide about my future and that's why I'm here to learn new things. 

So, I'm basically and literally noob to this. It's going to be a foreign language in a different world, to me.

I think that's all, folks!
